# Software / Repository

Read the code at your own risk, it's messy, and was cobbled together for this highly specific purpose. It contains a lot of small band-aid solutions to make things parse as they should or ignore edge cases, and isn't an example to follow.

After installing node.js and npm, the NPM scripts have each step needed to run it. It was designed to run via github actions.
